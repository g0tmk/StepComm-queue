Newline handling in stepcomm:

Use on these file systems:
    1. windows : CR/LF
    2. old mac : CR
    3. Unixes : LF
    4. Auto : TX mimics the last received line end sequence
    5. non-cononical : LF/CR - not used, but treated same as CR/LF for stepcomm

transmitted newlines:
    1. All data sources, comport, keyboard input, files, send buttons, and paste commands have all line end sequences converted to '\n' regardless of newline settings.
    2. recieved comport data and local data sources echoed to screen use the same '\n'.
    4. data transmitted to comport has the '\n' converted to the line end sequence selected in the txnl dropdown.
    5. if txnl is set to 'auto' then '\n\ is converted to the last line end sequence recieved on the comport.
    6. captured files are written with '\n' which is converted by python to the OS's line feed style.
    7. keyboard return/enter key can be either '\n' or '\r' depending on OS
