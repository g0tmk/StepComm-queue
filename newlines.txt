Newline handling in stepcomm:
Handle these newline cases:
    1. characters typed in keyboard and sent out comport and echoed to screen
    2. characters sent from send commands, or files sent out comport and echoed on screen
    3. characters recived from port and written to screen and written to capture files
    
Use on these file systems:
    1. windows : CR/LF
    2. old mac : CR
    3. Unixes : LF
    4. Auto : RX uses LF, CR, CR/LF, or LF/CR, TX is CR/LF
    5. Natural : TX uses the keyboard key (OS dependant), RX follows AUTO
   

Comport input is always handled automatically, LF, CRLF, CR, LFCR are all converted to \n for the screen and capture file.
The capture file's \n is converted by python to the line end pattern for the host system's OS.
keyboard input treats both LF and CR as an ENTER/RETURN key press, which get output to the port based on the TXNL setting.
Sent files have CR, CRLF, LF, LFCR sent to the comport based on the TXNL setting.
TXNL determines the sent file and keyboard input newline sequence sent out out to the comport as follows:
    windows => CRLF
    Unixes => LF
    Old Mac => CR
    auto => repeats last comport RX NL sequence
